# Laxbot 1.0 Overview

**Laxbot 1.0** is designed to become the **default source** for **lacrosse scores, rankings, and stats** — built with a core focus on **automation, reliability, and scale**.

## 🥅 Project Goals
- **Live Data First**: Deliver the most up-to-date lacrosse scores, standings, and player stats.
- **Fully Automated**: Build the backend to operate **without manual intervention**:
  - Agents scrape, ingest, clean, and update data.
  - No daily human maintenance required.
- **Supabase Infrastructure**: Manage data storage, authentication, and user management on a scalable serverless backend.
- **Modern Frontend**: Fast, clean React frontend built with TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, and responsive, accessible design principles.
- **Monorepo Architecture**: Clean separation of frontend, API, and database layers for easy scaling.
- **Scalable Launchpad**: Lay a foundation that can later evolve into a mobile app, fantasy sports extension, and premium features (e.g., alerts, forecasts, rankings analytics).

## 🔥 Core Ethos
> **Laxbot should feel like a living organism — pulling, cleaning, updating, and presenting lacrosse data automatically — while users experience a fast, beautiful, trustworthy interface.**

This is a platform **designed to run itself**, so we can **grow users, revenue, and reach without growing maintenance costs**.
